                    <h3>Background</h3>
                    <p>Hey there! I'm Berta and I'm currently studying Anthropology and International Development at the University of Sussex. I grew up in a small town in Spain and I miss it so much. </p>

                     <ul>
                      <li>I have been binge-watching "The Queen's Gambit" (Netflix)</li>
                      <li>Making my own pizza dough</li>

                    <h3>What I have enjoyed the most about CFG</h3>
                    <p>This course has made me realise that I’m not as bad in science as I thought I was. I have been told many times that computer science is a boys’ thing and I am so happy that I can prove them wrong. I am extremely proud of myself for pushing myself to do something so far away from my comfort zone. The best part is that this is an amazing hobby that I hope to keep practicing in the future!</p>

                     <h3>Background</h3>
                     <p>I am doing my final year of Psychology (with a professional placement year) at Sussex University. I am from Guernsey in the Channel Islands. I love baking, going to the beach and travelling.</p>
                     
                     <h3>My lockdown favourites</h3>
                      <ul>
                          <li>My housemates and I made a poke cake during Lockdown which was great fun, and I highly recommend baking in lockdown as it brings everyone together and think about happy times.</li>
                          <li>I also started practicing guitar more than usual, which made me fall in love again with the instrument.</li>
                          <li>Doing video calls with family and friends. Also doing online pub quizzes and other such events where you can meet new people and forget about the lockdown for a while.</li>
                      </ul>
                     
                      <h3>What I have enjoyed the most about CFG</h3>
                     <p>What I have enjoyed most about CFG, is that I've learnt a new skills, which I probably wouldn't have if there hadn't been a pandemic. It has also allowed me to get to know other Sussex Students, who I might not have normally met.</p>
